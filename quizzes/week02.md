# Intro to JavaScript

**1.** Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The 3 are let, const, and var.
```
**2.** What is the definition of a function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
I would say a function is a mini block of code to do something specific.
```
**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single responsibility, open closed principle, liskov substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion
```
**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It is in position 2, arrays count with 0 being the first position.
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```
how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
them.push(you.friends)
```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
if (x > 3) {
  then run me
}
```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The afterthought of the loop, i would increase i by 1 with i++.
```
**8.** What does the `DOM` acronym stand for? Which file is first accessed to render the `DOM`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Document object model, the index.html is first rendered.
```

**9.** What are the `9` ECMAScript types as defined by MDN?

boolean, parameter, oject, string, number, symbol, undefined, null, bigInt
```
**10.** When it comes to functions or methods, what is the difference between a `parameter` and an `argument`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Parameter is a banana word set for the function to have for the argument to come through.
```
**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Primitive is a static type of value like a string, number, boolean, and the reference type is a more like a object.
