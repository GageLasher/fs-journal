# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

    At first the MVC method was super confusing, but after wed and thursday it made so much more sense and I like using it to organize the code.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

    How easy the MVC method actually is once you start using it practically.

- What are you struggling with?
    Naming conventions and making sure everything is linked up.

- What would you count as a victory?

    Finishing the checkpoint and feeling like I have a good understanding of it.
