## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

    Encapsulation is for bundling data with the function or methods that act upon the data, also it prevents the user from accessing the data inside the classes the data is stored into.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
    The underscore prefix exposes some of the data to the user, showing what methods that are meant to be private, it is a naming convention used. With real encapsulation you dont have to expose any data you dont want the user to have access to.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
    You create a private variable using the #before the variable. We would do this if we want only the class to have access to it, it is locally scoped within that class only.
