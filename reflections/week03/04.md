> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

    Using reusable code that is one way data binding instead of having mutling data binding linking to lots of elements which is harder to keep in sync.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

    The subscribe, the unsubscribe, and the broadcast method.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

    With the event listeners it is noticing any change to any of our proxy objects.

Working with a team where one speaks and the other codes helps a lot to breakdown and really understand all of the code.
