## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

    Having to pull each idividual funtion or variable to other parts of your code. This allows you to push public all your code to a different code file.

2. How does export differ from export default?

    Export default will automatically assign default to the export.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

    It helps organize your code and make it clean, you can also make code private to the user and only let them interact with what you want the user to use.

Todays assignment helped me see how someone would go about organizing code using modules, it is still pretty abstract but I think it will start to make more sense when we start using modules on more practical assignments.
