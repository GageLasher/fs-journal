## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
    We are using vue frontend framework and node js technologies we are also using the agile scrum process and doing lots of stand ups!


2. What went well so far?
    So far we have been working fast and trying to keep as organized as possible. This has been difficult but we are trying are best to stay all on the same goal so when we code its easier.

3. What would you do differently? Why?
    Take some more time building a figma thats higher fidelity, build out our data models a tad bit more clear, and overall make sure we are all on the same page of the aim or direction of the finished MVP.
