## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
    Base64 is a coding schema that translate data into a text form.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
    When it gets translated it turns the memory size into 25% more than the original, also there is cpu overload, and caching issues.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
    In the old days 64bit was faster for rendering because it didn't have to take 2 trips to the server but nowadays it has caching issues, and more cpu load.
