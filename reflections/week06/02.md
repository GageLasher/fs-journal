## Questions

1. What are props?

    Props are similiar to passing variable into arguments in vanilla javascript, we are passing down variables to child components.

2. What are props used for?

    Props are used for sending variable to child components so the component has access to the variables you want it to.
    

3. Where can props be used or accessed?

    Properties can only be used in a parent to child relationship and not a child to parent. It has to be accessed in the child from the parent and it cant edit the properties as it is read only and doesnt exist in the child componenent only the parent.
