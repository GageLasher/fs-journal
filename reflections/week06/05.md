# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    Vue was super awesome and made things a lot faster, vue was also really easy to learn.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

    Just how cool frameworks can be!

- What are you struggling with?

    Just styling honeslty, I am horrible at it and nothing seems to want to go my way.

- What would you count as a victory?

    I finished the checkpoint on Friday, it took a while but everything felt pretty straightfoward.
