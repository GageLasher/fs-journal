## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

    To my understanding they sever as a fake property to a model Schema, they can be accessed like data, but they aren't stored as real data in the Db.

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

    We have used them to get data off of a parent data so we have acess to certain properties of another data without storing the data in the real db.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

    You can use a get method or a set method.
