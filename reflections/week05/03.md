## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

    Allocating a set amount of time to a task so your work expands to the time alloted. This strategy helps us fit work into a time frame and we work efficiently to fit in that time frame subconciously.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

    Timeboxing, using egg timers, and not working on other tasks during timeboxing.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

    I was working on styling to long and I should have set a smaller timeboxing window to reduce time wasted on styling.
