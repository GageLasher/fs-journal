# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

    The node.js made a lot of sense for me and was pretty straightforward.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

        Working as a group is pretty hard, and merge conflicts are tricky!

- What are you struggling with?
    I am mostly struggling with trying to recall information from last week efficientlly.

- What would you count as a victory?

    We as a team made good progress during the hackathon, this was really fun to do.
