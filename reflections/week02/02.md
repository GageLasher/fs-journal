## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

    A Function declaration, a function expression, and arrow function expression. Function expressions are not hoisted meaning they need to be declared before they are invoked.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments? 
    Parameters are the names created in the function definition, and arguments are what gets passed into the parameters when the function is invoked, making them the value of the parameters.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

    Higher order functions are when a parameter is a function or the function returns another function. An example would be the forEach() method.
