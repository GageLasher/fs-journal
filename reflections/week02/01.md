## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

    Scope is where the variable can be accessed, either globally or locally within a function.

2. What is Hoisting ?

    The variable or function is moved to the top of its scope before the code execution.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

    You would want to use const if you wanted to make sure that variable did not get reassigned, let when you are wanting it to be block scoped, and var when you want your variable to be able to be reassigned globally.
