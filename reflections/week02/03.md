## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

    Console logging is a main way to write information to your console. 

    You should use elements style when you want to edit your html or css properties to try to get an idea of what to fix or how things affect the DOM.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

    The element tab lets you breakdown html and css, this is useful for debugging html to see how your DOM gets affected in real time.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

    The debugger tool lets you break down each line of code as it runs so you can see what isn't working, personally for me I can see if my parameters are getting the correct arguments im trying to send into them.
