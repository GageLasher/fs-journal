## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

    If you make a plan you can check off what needs to be done and where you want to organize all the functions.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck? 

    It is a good practice to google someething and see if someone else has had that problem. This will save you lots of time trying to fix something someone else has already fixed.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

    Making code readable to other programmers and even possible product managers. Try to keep your code as simple as possible but without losing functionality.
