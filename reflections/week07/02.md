## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

    Code documentation is adding little notes before your function to explain what they do so you can later look at them to understand or your colleagues. You can document code by putting it in the source, doing a readme, or making a howto.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

    As I touched on earlier the benefits are more understable code thats in actual english instead of programming language, to help you and your peers better understand your code in a later date.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

    It is a good habit to build early and is super important for higher quality code since it can become learnable and reusable by others!
