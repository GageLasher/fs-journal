# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    Coding was fun this week with partner programming, the time alloted was comfortable for us and let us feel confident in tackling on our problems.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    The code was pretty repetitive and a lot of practice you can apply to other similiar problems.
- What are you struggling with?
    Our styling wasn't perfect and it is something I want to work on.

- What would you count as a victory?
    I got a rubber ducky, the project had a lot of requirements and it was a big time investment, I finished early on thursday which is a good releif.
