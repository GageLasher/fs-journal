## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

    User experience is all experiences a user has while interacting with anything on the app. Making sure the user experience is as smooth as possible and lets the user do what he needs to do or may want on the app.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

    The better the experience the user gets the better retention your app will have, the user needs to have easy access to the functionality your app provides.


3. Why is the User Experience important?

    As I touched on earlier, the UX is important for giving the user a good experience while navigating and using your app as you inted the user to.
