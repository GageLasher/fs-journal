# Sprint Retrospective

![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

    Honestly we just did pair programming and communicated the direction we wanted to write code in, and if someone didn't understand our direction we explained it.

2. What went well this week?

    This week we made a lot of progress quickly but got stuck on a few problems, we used this time when we were stuck to destress and walk and retackled the problem later, it helped us be consistent with our timeblocking.

3. What would you do differently?

    Probably just keep cleaner code, style better or while going so its easier to fix later down the project.

Today was just finishing notes, it was easy after having so many repitiions, started to feel confident in writing as the project progressed.
