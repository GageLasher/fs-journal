## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

    Git is useful for developers to make sure they are using the same version of code for parralel projects, also it allows devlopers to have access to their team devlopers code through a non local repository like a cloud based one as github. Git hub is also important as you can publish code on a test commit on a parrarel project and you can also see what changes were made to code.


2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

    As I touched on earlier the multiple branches can be useful for not committing to the master branch so you can test on a test branch.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

    Github is a remote respository and git is a local repository, Github makes it more accessible for programmers to work on parralel projects.
