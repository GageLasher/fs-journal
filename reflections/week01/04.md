## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

To have a visual of the layout and functionality of a site with a quick mockup, so designers can change things quickly to adapt to the needs of the users and stakeholders. Once it is in a final stage of wire=framing, this is when us the developers comee in and realize the final product in code :)

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There is low mid and high fidelity wire-frames. These are used to in order first start a quick sketch of what the product should be and use feecback to make changes to mid and then eventually to high-fidelity for the final product look.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yeah why not, the low tier fidelity wire-frame is super useful for developers who aren't designers just so they can visual out the bones of a website.

Afternoons assignment really helped me visualize and understand the gridsystem that bootstrap builds out for us. I also enjoyed the flex frog daily challenge, it made things more clear in my mind.
