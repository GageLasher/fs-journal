# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

    This week I brushed up on a lot of basics of html and css, I felt pretty comfortable with that, the Bootstrap was all new and confusing at first but it it coming very fast and is making a lot of sense.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

    The first week was pretty refreshing, I know the next following weeks are going to be very difficult, so I am mentally preparing for that.

- What are you struggling with?

    Some of the justify-content and align-content and how they affect everything is a little confusing but I am getting a little bit more familiar. 

- What would you count as a victory?

    The checkpoint came pretty easy this week and it made my confidence go up a bit :) I will take that as a victory.
