## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
Using hiearchy to structure design of your page rather than semantics.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas. 

I personally havent noticed accent colors on most sites, but it really looks fancy to make bland content more eye catching. The resource of not having to have buttons have a background color is a good one for design principle, only use colors if they are the Primary function of a given content.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Design of a website gives off the vibe of what type of website it is, a proffessional site or a fun engaging site will have dramatic design differences. Good design lets the user know what type of experience they should expect while viewing and interacting with a site.
