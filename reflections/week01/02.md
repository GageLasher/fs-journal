## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A Pseudo-Class is a class that is not permanently applied, only on a hover or a before of after.. The ones that I have used is hover, I assume I will use this one very often.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a math equation of how css will pull a certain value, with some selectors being higher value they will take priority over others. You can use this in your benefit by only having certain values be represented on the page whith a higher specificity in case you have similiar selectors.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

They take priority over all other specificity, this may run into problems with overriding multiple selectors you do not wish to in the future.
