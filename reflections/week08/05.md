# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    I finished my checkpoint on Sunday so monday I had a lot of time to prepare for the Capstone and have mental clarity and no stress..
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    I thought we would pass our presentation for the capstone first go, but we were under prepared and our data models were lacking a lot of relationships ties.
- What are you struggling with?
    Right now just making sure all of my dev team is in their right roles and doing what they want.
- What would you count as a victory?
    We are making good progress on our capstone and our teams mood is really good, we are working well together :)
