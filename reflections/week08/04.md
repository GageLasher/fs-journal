## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
    Unit testing, component testing, and end to end testing. E2E is when users are actually using your application, so this testing is arguably the best. Vue component testing is limited to the component being in the DOM. Unit testing is individual code testing is isolation.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
    I personally think E2E just because it is when code is supposed to all work and it is the user testing actual working parts of the application.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
    Probably unit testing just because it seems a little time consuming versus component testing.
