# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

    This week the mvc pattern started to make a lot of sense, and the power of holding data in the backend and pulling through apis clicked pretty fast.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

    Nothing this week was to suprising but just how taking a break from code and not overthinking things can make your workflow become so much more efficient. 

- What are you struggling with?

    I am not struggling with anything this week thankfully.


- What would you count as a victory?

    The checkpoint was overwhelming when I was first introduce to it, but it was suprisingly a lot easier than I thought, this was a victory week for sure!
