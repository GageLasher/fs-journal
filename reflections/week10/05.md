# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    getting introduced to c sharp was super cool and I liked how it is very similiar to node just a lot more stricter on the syntax mostly.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    How similiar c sharp is to node and how cool strongly typed langauges are.
- What are you struggling with?
    The repository layer is all new for me and not having mongoose and having to write my own sql statements is all hard but fun.
- What would you count as a victory?
    I finished by backend on my spice checkpoint.
