## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
    information in a column is a title or property tag, while information in the row is the value, so think of column is a key and row is the value.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
    CREATE TABLE characters(
  id int NOT NULL,
  age text,
  name text,
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
delete from tablename will remove all the contents of the table, while Drop table will wipe all the contents and the table itself entirely.
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Last day of gregslist connecting our services to a repository that connected with our mySql database. This was fun making our own methods for our database.
